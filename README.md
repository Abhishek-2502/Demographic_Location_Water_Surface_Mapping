## Introduction

In todayâ€™s world, where urban development and the impact of climate change present obstacles to our water resources, the Demographic Location Surface Water Mapping Project emerges as a much-needed initiative. This project aims to address challenges related to water resource management by mapping surface water bodies using satellite imagery and digital image processing techniques. Additionally, it incorporates the task of predicting future land and water patterns, providing valuable insights for sustainable planning and conservation efforts.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are multi-faceted:

1. **Data Analysis:** Analyze existing datasets and evaluate various image processing techniques employed in similar studies.

2. **Algorithm Development:** Design and develop machine learning algorithms tailored for satellite image classification tasks, as well as predictive modeling for future land and water patterns.

3. **Result Analysis:** Perform comprehensive analysis and comparison of results obtained from different approaches, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

## Problem Statement

One of the primary challenges tackled by this project is the development of an efficient satellite image classification system. This involves utilizing sophisticated image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to overcome obstacles such as sun and mountain shadows. By implementing shadow correction methods, the goal is to accurately differentiate between land and water areas in satellite imagery, thereby enhancing the interpretation process. Moreover, predicting future land and water patterns adds another layer of complexity, requiring advanced modeling techniques to forecast changes over time accurately.

## Dataset Description

The dataset utilized in this project consists of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images captured over the Pune District. These images offer a detailed view of the region's topographical and environmental characteristics, providing invaluable insights for geospatial analysis.

**Source:** The dataset was obtained from the US Geological Survey (USGS) Global Visualization Viewer, a reputable repository of satellite imagery.

**Spatial Coverage:**
- **Path:** 147
- **Row:** 047
- **Region:** Pune District

**Temporal Coverage:**
- **Start Date:** January 2023
- **End Date:** December 2023

**Note:** Images from July and August 2022 were excluded due to significant cloud cover, ensuring the dataset's quality and relevance.

**Data Characteristics:**
- **Resolution:** The images have a spatial resolution of 30 meters.
- **Bands:** The OLI sensor on Landsat 8 captures data across multiple bands, including visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared regions.

## Technology Stack

### Web Development

The frontend components of this project were developed using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Results

The primary focus of our research endeavors was to implement sun correction techniques and derive the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) from Landsat imagery. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour, XGBoost and Neural Network were employed for predictive analysis. By effectively applying the MNDWI and employing thresholding techniques, we successfully transformed continuous data into binary images. In these binary representations, water bodies are depicted as white pixels, while land surfaces are represented by black pixels. Additionally, predictive modeling techniques were utilized to forecast future land and water patterns, contributing to sustainable planning efforts.
